# Dashpro
Dashpro *Dashboard Pro is a server-client system used to manage remote and local device, allowing a IT administrator to monitor and protect devices against threats before they happen.


# Purpose
Dashpro is my cyberseciuty project for USC, the goal of my project is to monitor devices and provide a legup against threat actors before they strike.

# Usage
DashPro works by running a client program in the background on a client machine. The client machine reaches out to an API server with diagnostic information about the machine. The API handles the main logic of the network system and provides the diagnostic information to the dashboard program. Finally, the dashboard program displays the connected devices and their diagnostic information.
